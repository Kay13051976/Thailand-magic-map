### Solved bug
 - The contact page toggle menu did not respond. It has been sorted by restructuring the HTML.
### Unsolved bug
 - not sure if it is because of a bug or another mistake because it can not run in the Firefox browser.
### Mistake
  - The first plan was to create a social media website, but the mentor recommended doing something other than it. Because we need more technology to store data lost a couple of week time, then effect to run out of time to complete this project.
  - This project is too big, and I have done too many pages and too much work to complete.
